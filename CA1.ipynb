    "A graph is a type of data structure that can be considered a collection of nodes and edges. The edges are responsible for establishing connections between nodes, sometimes forming cycles and loops. Graphs can also be directed, with edges having specific directions, or undirected, which means that edges don't have a specific direction. Additionally, graphs can contain weighted edges, providing specific cost values to the edges of a graph. They can be efficiently represented through adjacency matrices or lists. Notably, a graph does not contain unique nodes or roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is a specific type of graph, composed of nodes and edges. Unlike a general graph, it cannot form cycles or loops. Trees provide a unique path between any two nodes, with a single node called the root serving as the starting point of the tree. The root node can have multiple child nodes. Trees can be further categorized into two distinct types: binary trees, where each node has at most two children, and non-binary trees, where each node can have any number of children."

Compare the performance of Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* search algorithm, referring to heuristics, to find the shortest path to the problem by implementing both algorithms programmatically and comparing the solutions generated in Mark-down. Refer to the complexity of the algorithms and compare the actual time it takes for the solutions to be processed."
